Database documentation:

For Users:
The users have a login system (username and password) 
If the user wishes to borrow a book, s/he searches for the author name in the search box.
The searched name pops up and the person is able to check if the book is available for borrowing. If the book is available for borrowing, the lenderâ€™s username is visible, the user can request the book and can borrow it.

For Books:
        Each book has a unique lender who is a user. 
        Every book has a state, whether it is available or unavailable. Whenever a user       searches for the book, and borrows the book if it is available. Subsequently the availability status changes to unavailable.
